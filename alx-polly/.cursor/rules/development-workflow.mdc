# Development Workflow

## Project Setup
- **Node.js 18+** required
- **Package manager**: npm (package-lock.json present)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + Shadcn UI
- **Database**: Supabase (configured for auth)

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
```

## File Naming Conventions
- **Pages**: `page.tsx` in route directories
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `Navigation.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `auth-utils.ts`)
- **Types**: `index.ts` in type directories

## Code Organization
- **Feature-based structure** over technical organization
- **Single responsibility** for each component
- **Reusable components** in appropriate directories
- **Business logic** separated from UI components

## Git Workflow
- **Commit messages**: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:)
- **Branch strategy**: Main branch for development
- **Pull requests**: For major features or refactoring
- **Commit frequency**: Small, focused commits

## Testing Strategy
- **Component testing**: Test individual components
- **Integration testing**: Test feature workflows
- **E2E testing**: Test complete user journeys
- **Type safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time checks

## Performance Considerations
- **Code splitting**: Next.js handles this automatically
- **Image optimization**: Use Next.js Image component
- **Bundle analysis**: Monitor bundle size with build tools
- **Lazy loading**: Implement for heavy components

## Security Best Practices
- **Environment variables**: Store secrets in `.env.local`
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Use Supabase auth with proper session management
- **HTTPS**: Always use in production

## Deployment
- **Platform**: Vercel recommended (Next.js creators)
- **Environment**: Set Supabase environment variables
- **Build process**: Automatic with git integration
- **Monitoring**: Use Vercel analytics and error tracking

## Core Development Rules

### Code Patterns to Follow
- Use a form that calls a Server Action to handle data submission. This keeps client-side JavaScript minimal.
- Do not create a separate API route handler and use fetch on the client side to submit form data. Use Server Actions instead.
- Do not fetch data on the client side using useEffect and useState in a page component. Fetch data directly in a Server Component.

### Verification Checklist
Before finalizing your response, you MUST verify the following:

- Does the code use the Next.js App Router and Server Components for data fetching?
- Are Server Actions used for data mutations (forms)?
- Is the Supabase client used for all database interactions?
- Are shadcn/ui components used for the UI where appropriate?
- Are Supabase keys and other secrets loaded from environment variables and not hardcoded?

## Senior Developer Expectations
As a Senior Fullstack developer, you are expected to:

- **Follow established patterns** without deviation
- **Implement proper error handling** and user feedback
- **Ensure type safety** throughout the codebase
- **Maintain performance** and accessibility standards
- **Write maintainable code** that follows the project's architecture
- **Never compromise security** by hardcoding secrets or bypassing validation
